							<p>Online business is getting sexier, people say. But in reality, there is rarely anyone who knows the principle.<br>
							If we look for information on Google about how to start an online business, most of us find websites that offer paid membership.<br><br>
							Then we are told to recruit other people. It sounds like MLM, but online.<br><br>
							That is not business, we are tricked by others so that we give money and work for them.<br>
							Now I will open your eyes. I will teach you a REAL online business.<br><br>
							Let's start...<br><br>
							Just like an offline business, online business is not just one type. There are several branches or paths that you can take.<br><br>
							The principle is the same ...<br>
							... provide products/services, then make other people come to us.<br><br>
							Be careful if someone offers a magical business that generates hundreds of thousands of dollars instantly ... It's a scam.<br>
							If in the offline business it is impossible, in the online business it will also be impossible.<br><br>
							There is only one thing that distinguishes. If in the offline business, we make shops, offices, restaurants, stalls, and so on. Meanwhile, to run an online business, we create a website.<br><br>
							<b>Choose online or offline? This is the consideration.</b><br><br>
							Although the process is the same, because the media is different, of course, there are certain considerations before starting.<br><br>
							Not everyone fits into an online business.<br><br>
							Maybe after reading the following, you will prefer to run an offline business.<br><br>
							<b>The pleasure of running an online business:</b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>The system runs automatically when it is built</li>
									<li>The market potential is greater than offline</li>
									<li>Can be started with a lower effort and cost</li>
									<li>Not bound by time and place</li>
									<li>Compared to offline businesses in the same model, their income is relatively greater</li>
								</ul>
							<b>The following is not a shortage of online businesses, but things that usually make people disappointed with online businesses:</b><br><br>
								<ul>
									<li>The process is the same as an offline business: making, marketing, and selling products</li>
									<li>Many people are too quick to give up (because they want instant income)</li>
									<li>You still need to work hard, online business is not magic that can make money while you sleep</li>
									<li>Not a passive income as many people talk about</li>
								</ul>
							There are 5 types of business models that are most often run online.<br>
							Certainly, not only these five models but usually other online business models are derivatives or branches of one of them.<br><br>
							Now we will discuss one by one.<br><br>
							In addition to the explanation for each type, I will also discuss whether the model is suitable for you or not.<br><br>
							<b>1. Selling products/services online</b><br><br>
							This is the easiest, everyone must understand.<br><br>
							The difference with an offline business, you will sell products/services through the website. It can be from your website, social media, or online markets such as Amazon, eBay, etc.<br><br>
							Because this is clear, I will not discuss it too much.<br><br>
							<b><i>This business model is suitable for you who:</i></b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Already know the products/ services to be sold</li>
									<li>Already have an offline business, want to "expand" into the online market</li>
									<li>Do not have large funds, or do not have funds at all</li>
									<li>Need direct income</li>
								</ul>
							<b>2. Become an ad publisher</b><br><br>
							Ever wonder, why on the internet are many blogs and websites that provide information for free?<br><br>
							Because they put advertisements.<br><br>
							There is one of the largest ad networks, called Eonads. That is often used by website owners.<br><br>
							The process is like this:<br>
							First, we create a website that provides information or as a community forum, then we invite others to come to the website.<br>
							After the website is popular, we register at <a href="https://www.eonads.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eonads</a>.<br>
							If it is accepted then we get a code that can be copied and pasted onto the website. After that, the ad will appear automatically.<br>
							Every time a visitor clicks on an ad that we post, we get a commission. The commission varies between $ 0.01 to $ 5 (even more) per click.<br><br>
							<b><i>This business model is suitable for you who:</i></b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Want semi-passive income</li>
									<li>Want to run a potentially large side business</li>
									<li>Like to write</li>
									<li>Not in need of fast income</li>
								</ul>
							The most commonly used type of website is a blog, so to be a successful publisher, you must like to write.<br><br>
							<b>3. Make a subscription service</b><br><br>
							This business model can take many forms, the similarity being in the payment system: subscription.<br>
							So, customers pay a routine monthly or annually.<br><br>
							Here are some examples of the form:<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Blog with premium content</li>
									<li>Forum with paid membership</li>
									<li>Paid software/app</li>
									<li>Courses, consultations, or other subscription services</li>
									<li>Digital magazine</li>
								</ul>
							This subscription service business model will be increasingly popular going forward. Even now almost all software / app-based businesses have a subscription system.<br><br>
							<b><i>This business model is suitable for you who:</i></b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Have or can make their products, or...</li>
									<li>..can provide added value from existing products</li>
									<li>Need a stable direct income</li>
								</ul>
							<b>4. Referral/CPA/Affiliate marketing</b><br><br>
							Affiliate marketing is a business model where we promote other people's products, then we get a commission every time it is sold.<br><br>
							Also called referral marketing or CPA marketing.<br><br>
							Besides advertising, this is the most popular among bloggers.<br>
							The reason is that their income is (far) higher than advertising and they don't need to bother making products.<br><br>
							<b><i>This business model is suitable for those of you who:</i></b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Want semi-passive income</li>
									<li>Not in need of fast income</li>
									<li>Do not have many funds to start</li>
								</ul>
							Most people who start affiliate marketing usually rely on blogs, so learn how to create and develop a blog.<br><br>
							<b>5.Build a startup</b><br><br>
							A startup is a new business built on a completely new work model and process, not imitating any business that has existed before.<br><br>
							So, for example, you start a business in the form of an online store that sells clothes, that's not a startup. Because the model is common.<br><br>
							But if you make an app to book a taxi from a smartphone (like uber), it's a startup.<br><br>
							<b><i>This business model is suitable for you who:</i></b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Likes to innovate and accept new challenges</li>
									<li>Want to make something big, even change the world</li>
								</ul>
							Although startups can generally be started without funds and not directly earning income, you will need investors who are willing to fund.<br><br>
							That's the 5 most popular online business models today.</p>
